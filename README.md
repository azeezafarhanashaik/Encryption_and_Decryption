This project is a simple command-line encryption and decryption tool implemented in Python. It provides a menu-driven interface with the following functionalities:

1. **Encryption:** Takes a user-input message and encrypts it using a specified key value.
2. **Decryption:** Takes an encrypted message and decrypts it using the same key value used for encryption.
3. **Information:** Provides a brief description of encryption and decryption processes.
4. **Exit:** Allows the user to exit the program.

The encryption method used here is a basic Caesar cipher where each character in the message is shifted by a certain number of positions based on the key value provided by the user. Decryption reverses this process by shifting characters back. This project is a good starting point for learning about basic encryption techniques and user interaction in Python programming.
